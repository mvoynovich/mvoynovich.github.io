      <h1>Lab 3: Build a Website</h1>
      <h2>Intro ITWS</h2>

      <h3>Create a personal Intro to ITWS website and deploy it to your personal web servers.</h3>

      <ul>
         <li>
            The web site will be placed in the "iit" subdirectory of your Azure instance. Refer to the tutorials from
            Lab 1 to get started.
         </li>
         <li>
            Guidelines:
            <ul>
               <li>
                  You must have at least two pages: home and projects.
                  Name these files:
                  <ul>
                     <li>index.html (this will be your landing page, or home page)</li>
                     <li>projects.html (this will be the main page to introduce your labs and should reside in a folder
                        other than your iit root. This should be according to your IA</li>
                  </ul>
               </li>
               <li>
                  You must have a consistent header, menu, content area, and footer across your pages.
               </li>
               <li>The only file in your root (iit) folder (at the root of your site) is the index.html page (.htaccess,
                  README.md, and any other files from lab1)</li>
               <li>
                  All resources (e.g. CSS files) should be kept in a separate area(s) as per your design.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Populate your projects page with links to the labs,
                  beginning with your resume; continue to do this as we move forward this semester.
               </li>
               <li>
                  As covered in class, your code must be valid and properly indented. (And
                  don't forget to set the &lt;title&gt; tag on each page.)
               </li>
               <li>NOTE: You already have an index.html page from Lab 1. You will edit this file to make it more suited
                  to your personal &apos;brand&apos;</li>
            </ul>
         </li>
         <li>NOTE: While not required for Lab 3 - you may want to start this lab by creating a branch called lab 3 and
            working from there.</li>
         <li>NOTE: At this point you must have security working for you iit pages on your site. If the pages are not
            secured you will lose points</li>
         <li>
            We will work through some of this together in class.
         </li>
         <li>
            You will graded using the following as a guideline. Creativity will be rewarded.
         </li>

            </ul>

         <li>
            I have included an HTML template to help you get started: <a href="iit-html5-template.html">HTML5
               template</a>
         </li>
         <li>
            Feel free to experiment and be creative - and <strong>use the web
               as a reference!!</strong> (e.g. <a href="http://www.w3schools.com">W3Schools</a>)
         </li>
         <li>
            <p>
               <strong>This lab is due by the date on the LMS assigment panel</strong>
               It must be posted to your Azure instance/Personal website located at <a href="#">FQDN/iit/index.html</a>.
            </p>

            <p>Please update your README.md file in your root directory and with comments
               about the lab, justifications for your chosen methods/styles/tech, etc. In the file, include the correct
               URL for your site. (remove any password entries from Lab 1)
            </p>
            <p>Include your outlines that you created in the IA class.</p>
            <p>By the time you complete this lab, you should have a copy of your iit folder;</p>
            <ul>
               <li>on your local machine for editing</li>
               <li>in your GitHub repositories</li>
               <li>on your Azure instance</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
               Create a zip file of your iit directory, name it - <em><strong>yourRCSid</strong>-ITWS1100-Lab3.zip</em>
               and submit it to the <em>Assignments</em> area of LMS. (it will contain your entire repository, with your
               HTML, CSS, README, and any other files/resources relevant to your site)

            <p>Include a <strong>working URL</strong></a> to your iit homepage in your README files.
            </p>
         </li>
      </ul>
