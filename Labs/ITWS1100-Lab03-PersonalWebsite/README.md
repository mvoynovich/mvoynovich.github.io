# Design Decisions

Made sketches prior to lab and decided upon sidebar 
Wanted to have a featured projects section on home page
Will swap them out when more labs or individual projects are finished
Current design is a bit boxy and clunky, but I think color palette and presentation are good
Will likely make website look more modern and responsive as I learn more and in free time
Will continually add onto and build off of
