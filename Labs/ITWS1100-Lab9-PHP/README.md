# Lab 9 - PHP & mySQL

All of the php Pages and functions are in the phpPages folder

There exists a dedicated functions (includes) and resources folder that the pages pull from

iit.sql is used to create the databases and data used on the pages

## Pages

### Index
Used to display actors and their date of births

Can both add and remove actors from the database

### Movies
Used to display movies and their year of release

Can both add and remove movies from the database

### Relationships
Used to display movies, their actors, and what their character was

Will possibly add a form to allow users to add a character that matches with an actor and movie already in database

For now adding the relationships and characters is done manually
