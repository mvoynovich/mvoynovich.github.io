# Lab 6
### Matthew Voynovich

## JQuery

Used JQuery to set up page for lab

Made list items change color on click and dynamically bound them whenever a new item was created

Used hide/show/toggle buttons to hide and show the instructions for the lab

Aditionally showed name on click of your name

## Part 4b

Solution to dynamically binding new lists to the on click event was binding it to the document instead of li elements currently on the page, so any li on that page does it not just li's on the page at the time of running
