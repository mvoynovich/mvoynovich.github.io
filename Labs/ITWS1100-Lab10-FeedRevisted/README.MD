# Atom & RSS Feeds revisited

Output of feeds is in the pages folder located at the index

The Feed uses the sidenav javascript implimented from the dynamic website

Additionally, the feed uses the index.css in the css folder and the feed.css to output the nice look

Rather than outputting the feed in the same way, the RSS feed was formatted to take up more space and look pretty with images

The Atom feed on the other hand was designed to be light and have minimal stylistic features in case you needed a more condensed version

You can locate the feed through either the lab 4 or lab 10 in the projects page
