# Lab8 - Dynamic Website

### Used Json and AJAX to make a dynamic and better website

Updated projects page to automatically update with new projects based on changes to the projects json page

Added Javascript script to add the side navigation bar for easier replication across website pages

Added a latest projects section to home that automatically puts the last three projects onto the page

Formatted the RSS and Atom scripts with AJAX so they could actually be displayed (only formatted RSS since they contained the same articles)
