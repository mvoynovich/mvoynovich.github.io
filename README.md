### Purpose

This is a personal website that I have created as a place to showcase my projects and information about myself. This website will host small passion projects I hope to pursue in the future alongside coursework that I think is important to share. Here, not only will you be able to learn who I am, but you will be able to see what I both love to do and can accomplish. 

## Projects

### Hound

Group project that I undertook with two other collaborators to provide solutions to RPI's lackluster lost and found system. This project not only helped me to further practice web development and strengthen my skills, but it most importantly taught me to use github and git in effective manners. Through good communication and use of tools like issues and branches, I was able to learn how to lead a project well and work with a team to accomplish development goals along a preset schedule.

### Fresh N' Clean

"Fresh n' Clean" is an on-demand laundry service platform designed to connect users with local laundromats and independent contractors, offering a seamless experience similar to Uber. Built using JavaScript and PHP, the platform integrates the Google Maps API for location-based services, allowing users to find nearby providers, and the PayPal API for secure online payments. The project was developed using a modified Agile Scrum framework, enabling the team to iterate quickly based on continuous feedback and evolving requirements. To maintain efficient collaboration, the team leveraged GitHub Projects and Issues for version control and task tracking, ensuring organized workflow management throughout the development process. This approach allowed for the creation of an intuitive, interactive, and scalable web application that meets user needs in the on-demand service space.

### ID3 Algorithm

In this project, I implemented the ID3 algorithm to construct a decision tree aimed at optimizing decision-making based on data inputs from a CSV file. By applying key machine learning principles, I calculated information gain at each node to determine the best attributes for splitting the data, ensuring that the most relevant features were chosen at every level of the decision tree. The implementation involved processing large datasets using Java, where the model learned to effectively classify and predict outcomes from both the training data and new, unseen data. This approach improved the accuracy of classification, making the decision tree a robust model for generalization to new data points. The project highlights my ability to handle data preprocessing, algorithm design, and model optimization, focusing on both performance and scalability.
