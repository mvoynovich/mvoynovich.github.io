### Purpose

This is a personal website that I have created as a place to showcase my projects and information about myself. This website will host small passion projects I hope to pursue in the future alongside coursework that I think is important to share. Here, not only will you be able to learn who I am, but you will be able to see what I both love to do and can accomplish. 

## Projects

### Homeful
Homeful is a full-stack web application designed to help RPI students compare off-campus housing options while also evaluating on-campus alternatives. Built with Node.js, Express.js, Vue.js, and MongoDB, the platform offers an intuitive interface for browsing, filtering, and analyzing listings based on factors like price, location, amenities, and lease terms. A RESTful API was developed to efficiently manage and retrieve housing data, ensuring seamless front-end and back-end integration. This API powers a dynamic comparison tool, allowing users to conduct side-by-side analyses of off-campus and on-campus housing options. The interactive UI, built with Vue.js, enhances the user experience with real-time search, map integrations, and a responsive design. Additionally, database management in MongoDB was optimized to store and organize housing listings, user preferences, and housing groups. With a strong focus on usability and accessibility, Homeful simplifies the housing search process, helping students find the best living arrangements to suit their needs.

### Automated Solver for Light Up (Akari) Using Z3 and Advanced Reasoning Techniques

This project houses the complete implementation, detailed documentation, and supplementary resources for solving the Light Up (Akari) puzzle using the Z3 SMT (Satisfiability Modulo Theories) solver. The project leverages automated reasoning techniques to solve puzzle configurations by encoding the rules of the game into logical constraints and employing Z3 to find valid solutions. The solver is designed to handle  board states efficiently, ensuring both correctness and performance. This project provided me with an insightful demonstration of how logical reasoning and constraint-solving technologies can be applied to solve complex combinatorial puzzles. It includes well-structured code, comprehensive explanations of the underlying algorithms, and examples showcasing the solver's capability across various puzzle scenarios.

### Fresh N' Clean

"Fresh n' Clean" is an on-demand laundry service platform designed to connect users with local laundromats and independent contractors, offering a seamless experience similar to Uber. Built using JavaScript and PHP, the platform integrates the Google Maps API for location-based services, allowing users to find nearby providers, and the PayPal API for secure online payments. The project was developed using a modified Agile Scrum framework, enabling the team to iterate quickly based on continuous feedback and evolving requirements. To maintain efficient collaboration, the team leveraged GitHub Projects and Issues for version control and task tracking, ensuring organized workflow management throughout the development process. This approach allowed for the creation of an intuitive, interactive, and scalable web application that meets user needs in the on-demand service space.

### Hound

Group project that I undertook with two other collaborators to provide solutions to RPI's lackluster lost and found system. This project not only helped me to further practice web development and strengthen my skills, but it most importantly taught me to use github and git in effective manners. Through good communication and use of tools like issues and branches, I was able to learn how to lead a project well and work with a team to accomplish development goals along a preset schedule.

### ID3 Algorithm

In this project, I implemented the ID3 algorithm to construct a decision tree aimed at optimizing decision-making based on data inputs from a CSV file. By applying key machine learning principles, I calculated information gain at each node to determine the best attributes for splitting the data, ensuring that the most relevant features were chosen at every level of the decision tree. The implementation involved processing large datasets using Java, where the model learned to effectively classify and predict outcomes from both the training data and new, unseen data. This approach improved the accuracy of classification, making the decision tree a robust model for generalization to new data points. The project highlights my ability to handle data preprocessing, algorithm design, and model optimization, focusing on both performance and scalability.
