            <h3>Avid Runner and Technology Enthusiast<br>CS and ITWS Dual Major @ RPI</h3>
            <p class = "aboutInfo">
              I'm a sophomore at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), majoring in Computer Science and Information Technology and Web Science (ITWS). With a passion for both fields, I'm delving deeper into programming and expanding my understanding of various technologies and fields. 
              <br><br>
              Currently, I'm enhancing my programming skills in C++, C, Java, and Python. I'm also actively involved in web development, working with HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP to build dynamic and responsive web applications.
              <br><br>
              In my spare time, I enjoy going on runs to alleviate stress and competing in races to better my times. My current personal bests are as follows: 52:39 (15k), 34:22 (10k), 15:52 (5k), 9:04 (3k), 4:32 (1600m), 2:00.5 (800m), and 53.9 (400m).
